# Club Rules

## Club Name

Saturday Morning Young Maker’s Club (working name, title to be confirmed)

## Aims and Objectives

To create an opportunity for children of secondary school age (years 7 –11 inclusive) to engage in technology, engineering and computing activities in a safe and friendly environment to develop technical knowledge and abilities in the company of like minded peers; for them to develop interpersonal skills and to have some fun exploring and developing projects that they are interested in. The club aims to supplement the excellent work and time that teachers give in bringing them on; they can’t do everything.
Venue and organisation: The ideal location for this type of club would be within the DT department of a school. Workbenches, a range of hand tools and equipment are present along with personal protective equipment.

## Club activities

A lot will depend as to what the members want to do. In broad outline, which is not meant to be exclusive, electronic, mechanical and computing aspects will be involved. This might take the form of kit making, specific and pre-planned ‘starter’ projects or individual projects that members creatively devise and can be realistically accomplished. It might be a finished product embracing a number of different areas of technology or some model. The objective being that it is something they can work on and take away when finished.

## Membership

The club will not discriminate against, race, religion, gender and ability.

Age will be restricted to that applicable to school years 7 to 11 (or upper age under 18?) for safety reasons.
A responsible adult will need to ‘join’ their child up and make their own transport/travel arrangements to and from the club. The responsible adult will be charged if they arrive late to collect their child. If something unexpected crops up, they should make alternate provisions for their child’s safe journey home or to another location.

The responsible adult will pay the membership fee in advance and also provide emergency contact details, along with any relevant medical and where appropriate, additional personal information.
Should the club be oversubscribed, there will be a waiting list and an offer to join will be made on a “first come first served” basis when a place becomes available.

If the member misses a session then no refund will be made, if a member decides not to come any more, a pro rata rebate will be made.

Members will be expected to work safely any serious disregard of safety measures will result in termination of members, They are also expected not to behave in an anti-social way or engage in bullying or any crime; such will be addressed by termination of membership.

Health and Safety the number of members need to be limited, therefore the club could not operate on a ‘drop-in’ or casual basis and would entail some form of membership and joining procedure.

It is envisaged that a membership fee will be applied.
The club itself will be run on the ‘not for profit’ model that at some future date might be converted to charitable status.

Current thoughts are that the membership period will be termly or quarterly with some provision for ‘try before you buy’.

At least one of the team would have an appropriate first aid qualification (training might be required for this).

All staff will provide their time and services on a voluntary, unpaid basis, and have extended DBS checks; the club will have safeguarding policies and procedures in place, with training as necessary.

Within the membership fee and maybe with additional external funding a small range of parts and kits can be accommodated. It would be expected that any expense over and above this basic ‘support’ level would be met by the member, that they would buy or obtain any additional items.

## Club operating hours

At this initial stage, it is hoped that the club could operate virtually every Saturday morning throughout the year, independent of school terms and through them. Initially, the club will run from 09:00 till 11:00 (2 hours) on the Saturday and if there is great demand for places in the club, an optional second session 11:00 till 13:00 (2 hours) extension would be desirable.

## Facilities required

Access is required on Saturday mornings to a DT workshop equipped with benches and stools, along with a range of hand tools. Often there is other equipment available within the DT facilities that would be desirable to use, for instance pillar drills, electric saws, sanders and perhaps laser cutter and 3D printer. What would be permitted for use by the club, any training and age restrictions would need to be agreed. A small storage space as part of a large cupboard, small secure room or similar is desirable for keeping securely any materials, tools and work in progress of the club. Access by club staff and members to IT facilities and network is also high desirable, see below for
further information.

## IT facilities

It is hoped that the centre can make available access to computers, their network and Internet for club staff and member use. Internet access would be required for research and access to electronically stored technical material on various components. Network access would be required for club staff and members for word processing and spreadsheet programs with facility to print (costs per sheet might apply – colour/black & white) and also to allow access to specialist technology software (CAD, CADCAM) to enable the design of electronic circuits, simulations and make technical drawings along with production, e.g. laser print. Additionally it is envisaged that some projects tackled will incorporate a small computer (Raspberry Pi) or microprocessor (Arduino) that will require connection to a host computer and/or network. Many schools and academies already have such devices and are geared up or getting geared up for their use within the curriculum due to imminent government changes.

## Materials and consumables

It is anticipated that the club would secure materials they need and not use any from the centre’s stock. It would seem logical that for items of a consumable nature such as glue, nails, screws and solder along with drill bits saw blades, latex gloves etc that some form of contribution for bits and pieces of this type is made by the club to the centre, either as a chargeable item or included in hire cost. Likewise the club would expect to make a contribution in some form for maintenance or service charges for equipment that is used.

## Clearing and tidying up

Members will be expected to assist with clearing and tiding to leave the workshop/facilities in a neat and tidy condition, as found. Debris will be swept from benches and equipment, materials etc stored away and stools placed under or on benches as specified by the centre.

## Health and Safety

The club would adhere to legislative requirements and that of the centre to ensure a safe environment for club staff and members. The policies and procedures would be in line with those in existence of the centre. Staff of the club may need to undergo certain specialist training in order to meet these requirements before certain types of equipment are used. Staff will adhere to fire safety measures and be familiar with procedures for alerting and dealing with any fire along with procedures for evacuation and emergency assembly point. At least one club staff member will be trained in first aid in compliance with legal requirements and to the requirements of the centre. The club would in the case of an accident and as appropriate make use of the centre’s first aid box. The club will maintain an accident book. The club would adhere to other policies in place within the centre concerning such matters as eating, drinking and smoking.

## Safeguarding

The club will produce and adhere to policies and procedures to ensure the safety of children is maintained. It is recognised that some specialist training is needed in this area. Currently there are four STEM Ambassadors, one of whom is female, willing to voluntarily work in this club, all have clear enhanced DBS checks. Any other adults assisting with the club that have contact with children will be subject to the same checks. If any discovery or disclosure of a child protection nature should arise the club will have a policy and procedure for this, again specialist training is likely to be required for this. The club will have a procedure for investigating any complaints concerning child welfare against an adult member assisting with the club.

## Insurance

The centre’s existing insurance policies may cover the proposed Saturday activities. If not the club will need to arrange their own, probably at least for public liability. Clarification on insurance requirements needs to be made with the centre and perhaps specialist advisors. STEM ambassadors are only covered by the ‘STEM’ insurance if a qualified teacher of the school in question is present.

## Financial matters

The club will operate on a ‘not for profit’ basis. It will receive income primarily from membership fees and have main outgoings for premises hire and materials; there will be other expenses. At this early stage it is not possible to provide estimates for these, there are still too many unknowns. Like any business, the club must be financially viable. Should there be any shortfall then charitable donations, grants gifts and sponsorship options will be explored to ensure the success and maintainability of the club.
